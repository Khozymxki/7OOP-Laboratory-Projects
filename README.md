### 🤖 ABOUT ME
"I love being around people whether it’s collaborating with teammates, spending time with family, or sharing moments with friends. These connections fuel me and give me the drive to keep learning and growing. Along the way, I’ve found passion in discovering new things, building confidence, and shaping the version of myself I want to be."
